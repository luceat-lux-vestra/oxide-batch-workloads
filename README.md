# oxide-batch-workloads

Independent, external consumer applications that validate published
[OxideBatch](https://github.com/luceat-lux-vestra/oxide-batch) releases —
real workloads built against the **crates.io artifact**, never a local
checkout of the framework, to answer with evidence whether a release's
public API is actually usable and what its guarantees really are.

This is separate from OxideBatch's own repository on purpose: a real
external consumer doesn't get to fix framework bugs by editing the
framework's source, and neither does this one. A defect found here becomes
an issue against `luceat-lux-vestra/oxide-batch`, never a source change in
this repository.

## Workloads

| Path | Release validated | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| [`csv-postgres/`](csv-postgres/) | `oxide-batch` `0.6.0` | Streaming CSV → PostgreSQL restartable batch import: transaction/checkpoint/restart semantics, crash recovery, application-level idempotency, resource bounds. |

Each workload is a standalone Cargo project with its own `Cargo.lock`
pinned to a published `oxide-batch = "=X.Y.Z"` (registry source, verifiable
in the lockfile — never a path/git dependency), its own CI, and its own
evidence under `validation/`.

## Adding a workload

A new workload gets its own top-level directory and does not touch any
other workload's dependency version, database schema, or CI job. See
`csv-postgres/README.md` for what a workload's own documentation should
cover (quickstart, schema, restart semantics actually observed, findings,
resource notes, evidence reproduction).
